# Path of Enlightenment

Path of Enlightenment is a game that was programmed for our fifth semester at HsKA for the Software Engineering class. It's written by:

* Tobias Kerst ([@TobsCore](https://github.com/TobsCore))
* Gregor Rydzynski ([@gregvary](https://github.com/gregvary))

## Documentation

The documentation and everything that's needed to understand the project's structure, is in the `documentation` folder.

## Game Play

The game play is described in the `gameplay.pdf` file. It's in German, though.
